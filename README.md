Sports Website by Dean Prach

===About The Project===
The idea behind this website is to combine two major elements: displaying relevant sports information, such as stats and scheduled games, and interaction between other sports fans. The frontend of the application uses React and JavaScript and is able to communicate with the backend through a Python Flask API that utilizes the MLBStatsAPI and webscraping to gather pertinent sports data. The application also uses MongoDB and PyMongo to store and retrieve user, player, and game data. Currently the only league implemented is MLB, however several features exist such as: retrieving the season schedule, viewing and simulating each game, visualizing MLB postseason results in bracket form from 2000 - 2024, utilizing a unique 3D way of displaying teams records, real-time communication within chatrooms, and the storage and display of player and team statistics.
